### My Version is Not Supported

If you can't find a fitting version of this plugin for your server:

- Download the nearest version of the plugin to your server version; most of the time, this will also work.

## Installation
***
1. Set up a Spigot/Bukkit/Paper server if you haven't already.
2. Download the plugin JAR file [here](https://github.com/AwayAllay).
3. Move the downloaded JAR file into the plugins folder of your server.
4. Reload the server by typing `rl confirm` into the server console.
5. Check if the plugin is correctly installed by typing `/pl` in the in-game chat or `pl` in the server console. It should appear in the shown list.

## Usage
***
_Commands are available for homes, warps, language, and configurations, most also accessible through a user-friendly GUI version._
### Commands
There are two types of commands, commands that manage the config.yml ([Config-Commands](#config-commands)) 
and the commands for the players ([Game-Commands](#game-commands)).

#### Game-Commands

##### Warp-Commands
A list with short descriptions of the commands can be output in the chat using `/warp`.

**Command:** `/warp set <name> <isPrivate?> <displayItem> <description>`  
**Description:** _Sets a warp at the players current location._  
**Parameters:** 
- `<name>`: the name of the new warp.
- `<isPrivate?>`: _True_ -> warp is only visible to its owner. _False_ -> it is visible to anyone.
- `<displayItem>`: The item that appears for the warp in the warp GUI.
- `<description>`: Here you can write a short description about the warp,




##### Home-Commands
***
And commands for the homes stuff.
